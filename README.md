## App features *(content will be modified after finishing the app)*:
**It's a weather app which can give you information about the wewather condition

     * Sample logo of weather
     * Changeble temperature
  * User can search about different locations.
  * User can know the weather of ten days in the future.
  * User can know weather information for past days.
  * User can change the time to know the weather during the day.


  ### nice to have features:
  * Automatically give the user information about current location.
  * User can present the data in different language.
  * Design different background images fit's with [PostNL](https://www.postnl.nl/en/) website style and make it change with temperature.
